Tic_Tac_Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax Algorithm

Game Board Representation:
-The game board will be represented as a list of 9 elements.
-The positions will be indexed from 0 to 8.
Minimax Algorithm:
-The algorithm will recursively evaluate all possible moves to find the optimal move for the AI.
Player Moves:
-The human player will be 'X' and the AI will be 'O'.

Working:
-print_board: This function prints the current state of the board.
-check_winner: This function checks if a player has won the game.
-is_board_full: This function checks if the board is full.
-minimax: This function implements the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the AI.
-best_move: This function uses the Minimax algorithm to find the optimal move for the AI.
-tic_tac_toe: This is the main function that handles the game flow, including player and AI moves.

  Execution in terminal:
  python tic_tac_toe.py
